# Splunk + Steampipe

[Splunk](https://splunk.com) software is used for searching, monitoring and analyzing log data.

[Steampipe](https://steampipe.io) is an open source CLI to instantly query cloud APIs using SQL.

List indexes in your Splunk account:

```sql
select
  name,
  max_time,
  total_event_count
from
  splunk_index;
```

```sh
+----------------+---------------------+-------------------+
| name           | max_time            | total_event_count |
+----------------+---------------------+-------------------+
| my_event_index | 2021-11-18T01:29:21 | 2345              |

connection "splunk" {
  plugin = "splunk"

  # If `url` is not specified, it will be loaded from the `SPLUNK_URL`
  # environment variable.
  url = "localhost:8089"

  # You can connect to Splunk using one of the options below:

  # 1. Authenticate using username and password
  # If `username` or `password` are not specified credentials will be loaded
  # from the `SPLUNK_USERNAME` and `SPLUNK_PASSWORD` environment variables
  # respectively.
  # username = "admin"
  # password = "password"

  # 2. Authenticate using Splunk authentication token
  # If `auth_token` is not specified, it will be loaded from the
  # `SPLUNK_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable.
